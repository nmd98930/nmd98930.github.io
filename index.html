	<h1>
		Man's Best Friend
	</h1>
	<p>
		For my Wild Card, I decided to use the website I created during this semester instead of a typical writing piece. In "The Doggie World of Nautas," I wrote about my four dogs, and using some simple HTML tags, I was able to format it like a real website that anyone can access with the hyperlink. Because I am not artistically gifted, programming or coding allowed me to go outside the box for my Wild Card. In making this website, I was introduced into how to use the basics of HTML, and this simple website may lead to future endeavors in coding. Furthermore, this allowed me to write on a topic I adore with all my heart, dogs. For centuries, these animals have proven to be faithful companions to humans, and as a result, they have become "man's best friend." In many creative pieces, dogs are featured prominently such as Argos in the <em>Odyssey</em> and have even been the muse of artists such as Cassius Coolidge's <em>Dogs Playing Poker</em>, showing how much impact they have on our lives. Similar to writers, dogs continue to give us entertainment and joy, and I want to show this message through my website.

	<h3>
		Lana
	</h3>
	<p>
		<strong>Lana</strong> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pekingese" target="_blank">Pekingese</a> and the oldest dog I have currently. My parents bought her last year in November as an early Christmas present for me. Despite being a tiny breed of dog, Lana can be fierce if she feels threatened by people and animals, and she is more aggressive compared to my other dogs.

	<h3>
		Chubs
	</h3>
	<p>
		<strong>Chubs</strong> is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulldog" target="_blank">English Bulldog</a> that my parents bought to embrace the UGA culture. While I thought this was slightly silly, I love Chubs despite being a bit slobbery. Currently, he has cherry eye, and while it is not harmful to him, the cherry eye is not going away. As a result, Chubs is going to go under surgery soon.

	</figure>
	<h3>
		Skye and Ramsey
	</h3>
	<p>
		<strong>Skye and Ramsey</strong> are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cane_Corso" target="_blank">Cane Corsos</a>. Even though Skye is 5 months older than Ramsey, he is already at her size and is still growing! Also, Ramsey and Chubs are best buddies who like to hang out with each other. Ramsey even slobbers like him. Skye is very energetic and loves to play with Ramsey, Lana, and Chubs, but she is a little rough when playing. When they are older, my parents intend to breed them with each other. That's why we bought Ramsey actually.
