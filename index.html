	<h2>
		Lana
	</h2>
	<p>
		<strong>Lana</strong> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pekingese" target="_blank">Pekingese</a> and the oldest dog I have currently. My parents bought her last year in November as an early Christmas present for me. Despite being a tiny breed of dog, Lana can be fierce if she feels threatened by people and animals, and she is more aggressive compared to my other dogs.

	<h2>
		Chubs
	</h2>
	<p>
		<strong>Chubs</strong> is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulldog" target="_blank">English Bulldog</a> that my parents bought to embrace the UGA culture. While I thought this was slightly silly, I love Chubs despite being a bit slobbery. Currently, he has cherry eye, and while it is not harmful to him, the cherry eye is not going away. As a result, Chubs is going to go under surgery soon.

	<h2>
		Skye and Ramsey
	</h2>
	<p>
		<strong>Skye and Ramsey</strong> are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cane_Corso" target="_blank">Cane Corsos</a>. Even though Skye is 5 months older than Ramsey, he is already at her size and is still growing! Also, Ramsey and Chubs are best buddies who like to hang out with each other. Ramsey even slobbers like him. Skye is very energetic and loves to play with Ramsey, Lana, and Chubs, but she is a little rough when playing. When they are older, my parents intend to breed them with each other. That's why we bought Ramsey actually.
